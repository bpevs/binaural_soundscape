Max MSP Dynamic Panner
=======================
A panner that uses a kinect to pan with head motion.  Simulates sound in a real-time spatial environment.  More info in-patch.  I haven't run it in awhile, but I'm pretty sure it also needs external resources in order to run.  Should be documented in the patch.
